       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, so I need to find out the details about the movie Pushpa. Let me start by recalling what I know. Pushpa is a Telugu movie, right? I think it\\'s a 2021 film. The director is Sukumar, who\\'s known for some other Telugu films. The lead actor is Allu Arjun, who\\'s a big name in Tollywood. The female lead is Rashmika Mandanna, I believe. The story is about a red sandalwood smuggler, maybe? There\\'s a plot involving the illegal sandalwood trade in South India. \\n\\nWait, the title \"Pushpa\" refers to red sandalwood, which is a valuable and protected species. The protagonist is a smuggler who becomes a hero or something. There\\'s also a part where he tries to take down the corrupt system involved in the smuggling. The movie might have a lot of action, maybe some heist elements. \\n\\nThe music is by Devi Sri Prasad, right? The songs are probably popular. The cinematography is by Ravi Varma, and the editing by Naveen Nooli. The supporting cast includes Fahadh Faasil as the antagonist, maybe? And others like Ajay Ghale, who played the police officer. \\n\\nThe movie had a big release, maybe in multiple languages like Telugu and Hindi. It was quite a hit, both critically and commercially. There\\'s a sequel planned, Pushpa 2. The first movie\\'s runtime is around 160 minutes. The release date was December 2021, I think. The budget was around 200 crores, which is huge for a Telugu film. It broke records at the box office. \\n\\nLet me check if there\\'s more. The story is set in Andhra Pradesh, focusing on the red sandalwood trade. The protagonist, Pushpa, starts as a smuggler for a bigger criminal, but then seeks justice when his brother is killed. The antagonist is the corrupt politician-businessman involved in the smuggling. The movie blends action, drama, and some social commentary on the illegal trade and corruption. \\n\\nThe reception was positive, with praise for Allu Arjun\\'s performance, the action sequences, and the direction. It\\'s considered one of the best Telugu films of 2021. The sequel is expected to release around 2024. \\n\\nI should make sure about the exact release date, maybe December 17, 2021. The director, Sukumar, has done other films like Mahanati. The writer is also Sukumar. The producer is Devi Sri Prasad under his production company. The movie was released in 4K and IMAX in some theatres. \\n\\nI might have missed some details, like the exact number of songs or the runtime. Also, the box office collection, but I remember it crossed 1000 crores worldwide. The cast includes actors like Dev Gill, who played the brother. The movie\\'s success might have led to Allu Arjun\\'s career reaching new heights. \\n\\nI think that\\'s a good start. Now, I should organize this information into a coherent summary, making sure to include the key points: director, cast, plot, release details, critical reception, box office, and sequel.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Movie Title:** Pushpa: The Rise – Ch01  \\n**Release Date:** December 17, 2021  \\n**Director:** Sukumar  \\n**Writer:** Sukumar  \\n**Producer:** Devi Sri Prasad (under Devi Sri Prasad Entertainments)  \\n**Music Director:** Devi Sri Prasad  \\n**Cinematography:** Ravi Varma  \\n**Editor:** Naveen Nooli  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Cast and Characters:**  \\n- **Allu Arjun** as **Allari Naresh** (Pushpa): A red sandalwood smuggler seeking justice.  \\n- **Rashmika Mandanna** as **Koyya Lakshmi**: A key character involved in the smuggling network.  \\n- **Fahadh Faasil** as **Bhagya Reddy**: A corrupt politician and antagonist.  \\n- **Ajay Ghale** as **DGP Ravi**: A police officer determined to stop the smuggling.  \\n- **Dev Gill** as **Pushpa’s deceased brother**: Central to the protagonist’s motivation.  \\n- **Raju Mandava** as **Jeeva Reddy**: A henchman of Bhagya Reddy.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Plot Summary:**  \\nSet in Andhra Pradesh, *Pushpa* follows the story of Allari Naresh, a red sandalwood smuggler who works for the powerful and corrupt Bhagya Reddy.
